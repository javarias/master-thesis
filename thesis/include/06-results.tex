\chapter{Tests and results}

Two sets of tests will be performed to benchmark the algorithms proposed for both problems presented in this work.
The first set will show how the solution given to ``Astronomical observation scheduling problem'', focusing the comparison with current DSA implementation done for ALMA.
The second set will show the feasibility of the proposed algorithm to solve the ``Array configuration planning problem'', focusing in the results for different scenarios.
